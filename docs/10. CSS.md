There are multiple ways to apply CSS:
* Simple CSS, adding into CSS file by tagging class-name etc.
* SAAS/SCSS: adding CSS programmatically like having variable, loops, if-else. discouraged for long projects
* Styled-components: design/add CSS at component level
* using libraries: like bootstrap, Material UI, ant UI
* Framework: like Tailwind
