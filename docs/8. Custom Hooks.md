Its very easy to write Your own hooks.
**We can treat custom hook as a utility function** to Abstract out some logic which may contains or where you can use other hooks also like useState or useEffect etc.
Basic Example of a custom hook below:
```js
// File: useRestraurantMenu.js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { RESTRAURANT_DETAILS_URL } from "./constant";
const useRestraurantMenu = (resId) => {
  const [restInfo, setRestInfo] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  const fetchData = async () => {
    const apiUrl = RESTRAURANT_DETAILS_URL + resId;
    const json = await fetch(apiUrl);
    const data = await json.json();
    setRestInfo(data);
    console.log(data);
  };

  return restInfo;
};

export default useRestraurantMenu;
```

I wrote one more custom hook where It will notify if client is offline.
I understood that custom hooks is utilis function for component life cycle. Main purpose behind using custom hoax is to abstract or encapsulate components lifecycle related logic like useState or useEffect hooks code you can keep in separate file but just this much will help enough to understand the flow like you should not think that as because custom books are written in some other file it also could have life cycle maintenance separately from the component using it.
### Points to note:
1. Filename should look like with `use__.js`. with `use` at beginning, react gets it that it contains custom hook logic
