In traditional websites, the browser requests a document from a web server, downloads and evaluates CSS and JavaScript assets, and renders the HTML sent from the server. When the user clicks a link, it starts the process all over again for a new page.

Client side routing allows your app to update the URL from a link click without making another request for another document from the server. Instead, your app can immediately render some new UI and make data requests with `fetch` to update the page with new information.


#### Basic way to create a browser router
```js
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
import AboutUsBody from "./components/AboutUs";

const AppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Header />
      <Body />
    </div>
  );
};

const route = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout />,
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    element: <AboutUsBody />,
  },
]);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(<RouterProvider router={route} />);
```
Try hitting: localhost:1234/about


### Adding children component
Router makes it possible to shift pages without letting browser refresh. Main benefit of this is we can re-use already loaded components. For example, we don't want to re-load Header, footer across every page load as those are mostly same.

So, in other words, if you use `<a>` tags to navigate then browser will reload the whole page but `children` component will ask react and in turn JS engine to load the page making lots of opportunity to re-use.
##### This is what will help you to make Single-page application
where you don't change the page, you're just erase the same page to draw again. 
This is also called **Client side routing** where navigation within an application or website occurs without full page reloads.

### How to write children elements?

You want to import and use `Outlet` from `react-router-dom` to use Children elements but that's not enough. You want to import and use `Link` for component re-use.


```JS
// Check in Header.js
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <div className="header">
// some lines
          <li>
            <Link to="/"> Home</Link>
          </li>
		  <li>
            <Link to="/about">About us</Link>
          </li>
// some lines
```

```JS
// from App.js for child element
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import Header from "./components/Header";
import Body from "./components/Body";
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Outlet } from "react-router-dom";
import AboutUs from "./components/AboutUs";
import Contact from "./components/ContactUs";
import Error from "./components/Error";
const AppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Header />
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
};

const route = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout />,
    children: [
      {
        path: "/",
        element: <Body />,
      },
      {
        path: "/about",
        element: <AboutUs />,
      },
      {
        path: "/contact",
        element: <Contact />,
      },
    ],
    errorElement: <Error />,
  },
]);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(<RouterProvider router={route} />);
```
**Link creates anchor tag element in HTML, but behind the scene, React router dom keeps a track for clicks **
### Notes
1. You want  a component to use either as children or root element. Don't mention same component in 2 route paths until you know. It misbehaved when I add <About/> component in `children` (nested) as well as root then I couldn't open the /about page. I had to comment 1 of them. Its mostly config so define it well
